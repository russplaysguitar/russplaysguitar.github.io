No, it's not just a new blog.</p>

<p>I've been working with a small team on some new ideas. Although it's still in the early stages, I think we're going to be building something that is really quite great.</p>

<p>In order to build this thing (and hopefully other things, too), we're going to be growing our small team into a not-so-small team.</p>

<p>This blog is an attempt to document the decisions that I make and explain the things I've created so that my team understands them well enough to make them better.</p>]]></description><link>http://russplaysguitar.github.io/why-am-i-writing-this-blog/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">50e279ed-c4b1-45ee-9ffd-dc3c71367027</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Russ Spivey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2014 22:37:28 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
