No, it's not just a new blog. </p>

<p>I've been working with a small team on some new ideas. Although it's still in the early stages, I think we're going to be building something that is really quite great. </p>

<p>In order to build this thing (and hopefully other things, too), we're going to be growing our small team into a not-so-small team. </p>

<p>This blog is an attempt to document the decisions that I make and explain the things I've created so that my team understands them well enough to make them better.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/why-am-i-writing-this-blog/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6a0a53ef-85f4-48e9-9f69-97b0b143a27a</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Russ Spivey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2014 21:55:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
